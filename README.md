# CeasarCipherConsoleCpp
 Project for exploring the ceasar cryptography cipher in cpp.
 
 
 Todo:  
-[ ] fix cipher: app is not encrypting or decyrpting special characters. (create bug?)     
-[ ] read and write to files with ceasar encryption.    
-[X] implement working script for encrypting and decrypting strings in a console  
-[X] implement OOP classes in Cpp  
-[ ] and recursion centric functions for OOP  
-[ ] create c implementation and use library.   
-[ ] create first test  



## Introduction - the project's aim  
Cpp App to practice and to familarlize myself with cryptology. The first cipher to study is the ceasar cipher.  

## Technologies
Project is created with:  

C++

## Project status
The project is 'in progree' 
Setting up working enviroment. (in progress)  
 *visual studio 2019  

   

## Sources  
for understanding recurision

## Scope of functionalities
basic functions  
* basic procedural implementation in cpp
* basic OOP implementation with cpp
* using c library for cpp console  

OOP functions
* use classes
* use resursive method
  


system function  

* deploy with Docker ()  
* documented with github    
* build through github actions  
* create unit test program. (how does this work with github)
