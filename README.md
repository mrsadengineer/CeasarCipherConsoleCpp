# CeasarCipherConsoleCpp
 Project for exploring the ceasar cryptography cipher in cpp.
 
 
 Todo:  
 -read and write to files with encryption.   
 -may move to c implementation because I am not using classes  
 -create implementation using classes and recursion  



## Introduction - the project's aim  
App to practice developing a ceasar cipher for the programming language of cpp.     

## Technologies
Project is created with:  

C++

## Project status
The project is 'in progree' 
Setting up working enviroment. (in progress)  
 *visual studio 2019  

   

## Sources


## Scope of functionalities
basic functions

* basic OOP implementation with cpp
* using c library for cpp console  

OOP functions
* use classes
* use resursive method
  


system function  

* deploy with Docker ()  
* documented with github    
* build through github actions  
* create unit test program. (how does this work with github)
